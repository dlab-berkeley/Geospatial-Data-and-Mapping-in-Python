    "    - <u>Pros</u>:\n",
    "        - Best for data spread across entire range of values.\n",

    "    - <u>Cons</u>:\n",

    "        - Bins ranges based on the number of observations, not on the data values.\n",
    "        - Thus, different classes can have very similar or very different values.\n",

    "    - Minimizes within-class variance and maximize between-class differences.\n",
    "    - Typical method is `'fisher-jenks'`.\n",
    "    - <u>Pros</u>:\n",
    "        - Great for exploratory data analysis, because it can identify natural groupings.\n",
    "    - <u>Cons</u>:\n",
