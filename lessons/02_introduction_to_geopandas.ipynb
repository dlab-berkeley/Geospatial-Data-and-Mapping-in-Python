    "## What is GeoPandas?\n",
    "\n",
    "[GeoPandas](http://geopandas.org/) is a relatively new package that makes it easier to work with geospatial data in Python. In the last few years it has grown more powerful and stable, allow Python to practioners to more easily and flexibly work with geospatial data in Python, which had been difficult in the past. GeoPandas is now the go-to package for working with `vector` geospatial data in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Protip**: If you work with `raster` data, check out the [rasterio](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package. We will not cover raster data in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "GeoPandas gives you access to all of the functionality of [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), which is the primary data analysis tool for working with tabular data in Python. GeoPandas extends pandas with attributes and methods for working with geospatial data. So, if you're familiar with pandas, working with geospatial data is a natural next step."

    "* `shp`: The main file that stores the feature geometry\n",
    "* `shx`: The index file that stores the index of the feature geometry  \n",

    "* `prj`: The file that stores the coordinate system information. (should be required!)\n",
    "* `xml`: Metadata: Stores information about the shapefile.\n",
    "* `cpg`: Specifies the code page for identifying the character set to be used.\n",
